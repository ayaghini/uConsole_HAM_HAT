The **uConsole HAM Radio HAT** is a dedicated expansion board designed for **ham radio operators**.  
It enables full **digital mode operation** (receive and transmit) on the **2-meter band** using an **SA818 transceiver module**, providing both **audio** and **serial control** paths.

## ‚ú≥Ô∏è Features

- **Integrated sound modem** for digital mode operation  
- **PTT and serial control** interface for SA818 module  
- **Dedicated audio and serial ports** ‚Äî fully compatible with **Digirig cables and configurations**  
- **10/100 Ethernet interface** for network connectivity  
- **Dual connectivity options**:
  - Direct connection to the **uConsole AIO extension** via internal 4-pin pads  
  - External connection via **USB-C** port (works as a standalone portable device)
- Clean power and ground isolation design for low noise operation

## üîß Usage

The HAT can operate either:
1. **Internally**, mounted on the top of the uConsole, and connected inside the uConsole through the exposed 4-pin connector, **or**
2. **Externally**, using any other computer, as a standalone portable interface connected via **USB-C**.

This flexibility allows the board to serve as both a fixed and field-portable digital interface for modern ham operators.
